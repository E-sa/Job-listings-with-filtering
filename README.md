# Job-listings-with-filtering

This is my solution to THIS challenge:
[https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt]

UI is a bit diffrent;


To run:


    1.download repository
  
    2.run "npm install" 
  
    3.run "npm start"
  
    4.see the result on browser
  
  
  Also LIVE version is available on:
  [https://psd-2-job-listings-with-filtering-gye4so1jo.vercel.app/]  (VPN might be require)
  
  How to work with SEARCH INPUT:
  
  
  type any programming language available in the list; like CSS, Python... (Its case sensetive)
  submit it and u only see filtered results.
